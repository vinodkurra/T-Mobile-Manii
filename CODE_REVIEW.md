Add Comments: Comments can give future developers (or yourself) a better understanding of the code, especially for larger or more complicated modules.
Lack of Comments: if there are no comments to describe the purpose of the different parts of the code, which can make future maintenance more difficult.

(1) libs\books\feature\src\lib\book-search\book-search.component.ts

Code Issues:

. Type Ambiguity: The type of date in formatDate() is void | string, which is not very descriptive. A better approach could be using string | null if the variable can be null.

. Method Complexity: The searchBooks method is doing two things: either searching books or clearing the search. The method could be refactored for single responsibility.

Improvements:

. Type Refinement: Changed date: void | string to date: string | null in formatDate.

. Single Responsibility: Split searchBooks into two methods for searching and clearing, thus adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

(2) libs\books\feature\src\lib\reading-list\reading-list.component.ts

Code Issues:

. Type Annotations Missing: The item parameter in removeFromReadingList has no type annotation.

. Unspecified Return Types: The removeFromReadingList function doesn't specify a return type.

Recommended Improvements:

. Add Type Annotations: Added type annotations for item in removeFromReadingList.

. Specify Return Types: Explicitly stated that removeFromReadingList returns void.

(3) libs\books\feature\src\lib\total-count\total-count.component.ts

Code Issues :

. Unspecified Observable Type: The totalUnread\$ property is missing a type annotation to indicate it's an observable.

Recommended Improvements:

. Specify Observable Type: To maintain good type safety practices, specify that totalUnread\$ is an observable.

(4) libs\books\feature\src\lib\books-feature.module.ts

Code Issues :

. Unsorted Imports: While not a "code smell" per se, sorting your imports alphabetically by module can improve code readability.

. Duplicated Code for Exports: The same array EXPORTS is being spread for both the exports and declarations arrays. While this is not a problem here, if you were to add components, directives, or pipes that should not be exposed outside the module, you would need to handle them separately.

Recommended Improvements:

. Sort Imports: Sort the imports alphabetically for better readability.

. Explicit Export and Declaration Arrays: Though the EXPORTS array makes the code DRY, it may be more explicit to separate what needs to be exported from what needs to be declared.

(5) libs\books\data-access\src\lib\+state

Summary of Improvements

. Sort all imports in alphabetical order for better readability.

. Add a null check for the state variable in the reducer function.

(6) libs\api\books\src\lib

Summary of Improvements (All the below issues are fixed)
